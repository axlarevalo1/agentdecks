    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Welcome to AgentDecks – a powerful tool designed by an agent, for agents. As a former insurance agent and a current real estate agent, I understand the frustrations you face in trying to close deals. 
        Whether it’s losing credibility due to inaccurate calculations or missing out on a sale because your presentation didn’t look professional, I’ve been there.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        That’s why I created AgentDecks – a free, easy-to-use platform with powerful tools that help you deliver accurate, client-ready presentations. From mortgage calculations to refinance comparisons, 
        every tool is designed to be clear, accurate, and professional – so you can close more sales with confidence.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Currently, AgentDecks is supported by ad revenue, which allows us to keep these tools free for you. 
        However, we are also working on a premium version without ads, which will offer even more features – including personalization options and the ability to brand your presentations.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        This is just the beginning. We will continue to add more tools and features over time to better serve you. If you have any suggestions for new calculators or improvements, we would love to hear from you. 
        Visit our <a href="contact.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 font-semibold">Contact Us</a> page to share your feedback.
